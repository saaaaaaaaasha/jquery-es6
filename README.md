## Installation

To get started, navigate into the folder and install the npm-modules.
```bash
cd jquery-training
npm install
```

## Compiling ES6 to ES5

After npm-modules have been installed, use Babel script to convert the `src` files. Browserify is also used so that `module.exports` and `require()` can be run in your browser.

```bash
npm run compile
```
